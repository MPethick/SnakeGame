A Verilog based snake game designed for the [Arty A7-35T FPGA development board](https://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/1-elhaap.html) in combination with [Pmod VGA](https://digilent.com/shop/pmod-vga-video-graphics-array/?srsltid=AfmBOooe0jwhbWwuMDEbk5Pk4bJnupd_7TerAt0HXU-GQ9sl8MquOqLh) peripheral or with the [RealDigital Boolean Board](https://www.amd.com/en/corporate/university-program/aup-boards/realdigital-boolean-board.html) via its in-built HDMI. To create the project, run the script found at [./snake_game.srcs/scripts_1/new/build_design.tcl](https://github.com/MPethick/SnakeGame/blob/master/snake_game.srcs/scripts_1/new/build_design.tcl). A generated binary and bitstream for the latest version of the project can be found in [./snake_game.runs/impl_1/](https://github.com/MPethick/SnakeGame/tree/master/snake_game.runs/impl_1).
